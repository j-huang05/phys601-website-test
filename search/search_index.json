In a surprising turn of events, Dr. Simpson achieved a remarkable feat by securing an Olympic medal in fishing. Her passion for this age-old practice, cultivated during moments of respite from the rigors of academic research, led her to compete on the international stage. Driven by discipline, patience, and an innate connection to nature, she demonstrated an exceptional skill in the art of angling. Her Olympic success not only reflects her versatility but also serves as a testament to the notion that the pursuit of excellence transcends conventional boundaries, showcasing the multifaceted nature of an individual whose talents extend beyond the confines of a laboratory or observatory.</p>"},{"location":"about/skiing/","title":"Skiing","text":"<p>I started skiing at the age of 10 and it quickly became my favourite sport (sadly it's only available for 1/3 of the year).
