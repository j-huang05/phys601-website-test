# Welcome to My Research Page


<!-- ![Coma cluster](./media/Crab_Nebula.jpg "Crab Nebula"){align="left": style="height:150;width:150px"} -->
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Physics at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. Jason W.T. Hessels. As a radio astronomer and member of the [AstroFlash](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/) and [CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca/en) Collaborations, my research focuses on radio transients; in particular, (repeating) fast radio bursts, pulsars and long-period radio transients. 

If you're like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/research_index.md).
